      He differs from the game version a lot. In the mangas, he doesn't know
      Blue until after he meets Team Rocket the first time, talking about a mew.
      He sees Blue battling the mew with a charmander, as he recalls the
      pokemon. The sight of Blue recalling the charmander angers Red, so he
      tries to battle the mew. He is quickly beaten, as the only pokemon he has
      is a poliwhirl.

    <h4>Red's Journey</h4>
    <p class="words">

      drowning, and the poliwag couldn't save him. He beat and became the
      champion in from the Red, Green, and Blue chapter. In the Yellow chapter,
      years after the last chapter, He goes to Mt. Moon to battle Bruno. He is
      then confronted by Lorelei and Agatha. Soon after, Lorelei freezes him in
      ice.
